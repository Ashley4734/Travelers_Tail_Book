Jeff Thorne's life in Mayfield, Iowa is the definition of ordinary. Same job. Same routine. Same crushing sense that there should be more to existence than this.

Then he finds a book at a yard sale.

No title. No author. Just strange symbols and impossible drawings of worlds beyond imagination. When Jeff follows the book's cryptic instructions to an old bridge in Mayfield Park, he discovers a portal to the Nexus Market—a crossroads where countless realities converge, where beings from across the multiverse trade in wonders and impossibilities.

The book chose him. Now Jeff is a Traveler.

But the gift of crossing worlds comes with a price. Reality itself is fraying at the edges, and an ancient force known as the Void seeks to unmake everything that exists. As Jeff joins the Guardian Conclave—a band of protectors from across the infinite realms—he must learn to wield the Codex's power before the balance of existence collapses.

From the mundane streets of a small Midwestern town to the furthest reaches of the cosmic tapestry, Jeff Thorne will discover that the extraordinary has always been hiding in plain sight. That every reality, no matter how small, matters. And that sometimes the most ordinary person can become the key to saving everything.

Perfect for fans of portal fantasy, multiverse adventures, and stories where the everyday becomes extraordinary.
